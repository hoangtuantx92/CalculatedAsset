Assign2: Due 11:59PM October 13

A user has stocks in many companies. Write a program that will find the net asset value of their stocks and display it.

The program will read a file which has details of stock symbols and the number of shares of each stock the user owns.
For example
XYZ1 1000
XYZ2 1500
XYZ3 2312
...
XYZI 1000
XYZJ 1000

Assuming the price for each of those stocks on the top is $1, $2, and $3, and the stocks at the bottom are either invalid or runs into error when fetching.
Then the output would look like:

Symbol  Shares  Net Asset Value
--------------------------------
XYZ1  	1000		$1000.00
XYZ2	1500		$3000.00
XYZ3  	2312  	        $6936.00
...
Total       $.....total of all the net asset values...

Errors:
XYZI  Invalid stock symbol
XYZJ  Error reaching the network

You may obtain the stock price from the URL
http://download.finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?s=SYMBOL&f=snbaopl1

where SYMBOL should be replaced by a symbol. We can extract the value of the stock price from the numbers returned by this link.

A few suggestions that can help you succeed on this assignment:

Start really early, move forward incrementally with the help of feedback loops.

Don't bring in dependencies until you no longer can avoid them (last responsible moment).

Start with a few tests, minimum code to make those work. 

Bring forward practices and tools you learned from assignment 1. Verify that your build is passing for assignment 2 in continuous integration.
